Hi, Thanks a lot for the hard work.

You may have heard people say that everything in Ruby is an object. If this is true, it means that every piece of code you write "belongs" to an object.

self is a special variable that points to the object that "owns" the running code. Ruby uses self everywhere:

     - For instance variables: @myvar
     - For the method and constant research
     - When defining methods, classes and modules.
